One of <a href="http://audiojungle.net/user/peterkappus/portfolio" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://audiojungle.net']);" title="Peter's Music Portfolio on Audiojungle">several tracks available for professional licensing</a> this uplifting, high-energy track crosses between electro, dub, 80s, and hip-hop feels. It’s full of catchy synth hooks, bouncy syncopated drums and a grooving organ riff that build up and break down several times taking you to a place that is at once, happy, laid-back, hopeful, and confident. It’s designed to be modular, and easily edited to extend or reduce the length as needed.
