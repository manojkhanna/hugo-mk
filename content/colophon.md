This is a static site made with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to replace an old WordPress site. This makes it super snappy and means I can host it in an [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) bucket for pennies a month. I considered using one of the gajillions of beautiful free themes out there but wanted something unique and opted to build something myself with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I'm using the excellent [ACE](https://github.com/yosssi/ace) templating language since I'm a lazy developer. It deploys in a snap using [S3sync](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync). The type is good ol' [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Helvetica).
