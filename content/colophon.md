This is a static site made with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to replace an old WordPress site. This makes it super snappy and means I can host it in an [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) bucket for about 20p a month. I considered using one of the gajillions of beautiful free themes out there but wanted something unique and opted to design and build it myself. It uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the excellent [ACE](https://github.com/yosssi/ace) template language. It deploys in a snap using [S3sync](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync). The type is good ol' [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Helvetica).
