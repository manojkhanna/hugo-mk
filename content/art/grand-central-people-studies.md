I moved to New York in 1999. I was remember being completely taken by the city and inspired by everything surrounding me. I saved my pennies and bought a gigantic Sony Mavica (and a box of floppy disks to carry around). I could store about 12 pictures on each floppy.

Probably my favourite thing about the camera was that you could manually adjust (or optically blur) the focus on your photo. One evening in Grand Central Station I stood at the west entrance (near the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=campbell+apartment" target="_blank">Campbell Apartment</a>) and took a series of photos of various people standing in front of the dramatic back-lit translucent stone entry at the Metrazur restaurant (now an <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/grandcentral/" target="_blank">Apple Store</a>).
