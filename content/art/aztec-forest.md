A nod to modernist Latin American abstract geometric design and institutional interior design of the 60s and 70s, this piece was rendered via custom image-analyisis software with lots of semi-randomized concentric rectangles using a palette that evokes walking through a mysterious lush green forest with a red mossy floor. I&#8217;d love to see this in a woven rug or ceramic tile format.
