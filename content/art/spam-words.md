2005

Around 2002, I started noticing pseudo-random words appearing at the foot of spam emails I received. I realized these were placed there to deceive spam-filters into thinking that these were legitimate emails. By including non-spammy text, the spammers had a greater chance of getting through. I started collecting these words and, by 2004 I had several thousand of these words and phrases collected.

In 2005, I was lucky enough to get a computer virus which left a large file of these words on my hard-drive. I believe my machine was being used to send spam emails. I found this a really interesting statement on how advertising too often infects and subverts normal human interaction and semantics with a kind of pseudo-random, highly aggressive, and moderately malignant &#8220;noise&#8221;.

By randomly pairing these words with 4 random musical tones to create a chord which is either harmonious or discordant I was able to create a highly charged emotional space in which the viewer&#8217;s mind struggles to assign (or find) meaning and significance in a completely randomized condition. I&#8217;d love to see this as a large-scale indoor projection in a dark room.
