He&#8217;s more boring than you thought&#8230; Taken from a photo of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail surrounded by his supporters, this abstract geometric piece was generated via custom software which divvies up an image into a grid structure, determines the dominant colour in each square and re-generates the image in solid discs.
