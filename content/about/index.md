  <p style="line-height: 2.5rem"> And for the past twenty years I've helped teams to get better at building digital products and having fun while they do it.</p>
</div>

I was born in **London** (UK) but grew up in St. Louis MO (USA), then Denver CO, then Boulder CO where I studied art, architecture, and computer science at [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/), and then New York City (Brooklyn), then Seattle where I helped build a [digital agency](http://designcommission.com/), and now I'm growing up in London (again).

I love [art](http://www.abstraktor.com) (especially modern art), [music](/music) (especially electronic), writing code, and working with people to make cool things (like a trading platform, data-mining tools, a mobile content company, a digital marketplace for the UK government, and a way for the TV & Radio crew at the BBC to manage its ambitious change portfolio).

To do this, I've used a lot of lean/agile practices, including things like systems thinking, [Objectives & Key Results](/okr), Liberating Structures [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/), and [Nonviolent Communication](/nvc). I've built things using C++, HTML, JavaScript, Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, and even Perl (back in the day... because everyone needs a guestbook for their website, right?)
