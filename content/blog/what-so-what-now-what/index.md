As long as we're growing, be it personally, professionally, or in any other way, we're constantly being confronted with new events and new information. Our task as engaged colleagues, artists, mentors, teams, leaders, companies, friends, lovers, etc. is to constantly look at each piece of information and decide the following: 

>
* What are we observing?
* What does it mean to us?
* What should we do next?

In other words **Observe, then Evaluate, then Respond**.

Clearly delineating each step provides structure and intentionality to what can otherwise, be a highly chaotic and emotionally charged process. 

In <a href="/blog/nvc">Nonviolent Communication</a>, the first step in looking at any complex interpersonal situation is to make a purely objective observation about what has happened, without any language that implies blame or judgement, whatsoever. This is easier said than done.

When working in an Agile team, we use the "daily standup" meeting to talk about what we've done, and what we're going to do next. At the end of each sprint, we look objectively at what has been delivered, then we "retrospect" about what it means and how to get better at delivering, and, finally, we make a commitment about what to do differently in the next sprint.

When using quarterly <a href="/blog/running-an-okr-setting-workshop/">OKRs</a>, we quantifiably measure the outcomes of our Key Results, and then capture our "Lessons Learned" and use this to determine what objectives to pursue next and how to measure them.

When responding to a crisis, whether in the moment or afterwards as part of a <a href="/https://github.com/etsy/DebriefingFacilitationGuide/tree/master/guide">post-incident-review</a>, the first step is always to gather accurate, factual information (without any judgement), then to evaluate what it means, and finally to agree a course of action.

Each of these is version of **<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/">What? So what? Now What?</a>**, a phrase I first read in the book <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a>.

When faced with a complex, frightening, or confusing situation I find it enormously useful to myself (and the teams I work with) to step back, breathe, and remember these three steps. It prevents us running around like headless chickens and gives us clear time and space to firstly gather information and agree upon what we're looking at (without any judgement or "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=solutionizing">solusionizing</a>"), then decide what these observations mean (judge & evaluate to our hearts' content), and, finally, to agree what to do next (_time to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategery">Strategerise</a>_)!

I hope it helps you and your teams, too!
