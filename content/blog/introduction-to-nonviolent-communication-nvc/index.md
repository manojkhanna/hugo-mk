**Nonviolent Communication** or NVC is a vast and nuanced area of study but the basic concepts can be grasped and applied almost immediately. I recently gave a short training session to a few  colleagues and promised to write up short post introducing it. 

## What is Nonviolent Communication?
The founder of NVC, [Marshall Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I&t=51" target="_blank">didn't like</a> the name "Nonviolent Communication" for the same reason [Ghandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) didn't like the term "nonviolent": it described what something _isn't_ instead of what it _is_. NVC has a very simple purpose:

> ### Nonviolent Communication connects us to the feelings and needs within ourselves and others.

## Why is it great?
This provides several benefits allowing us to:

* Resolve conflict in many forms and in various areas of our lives
* Enjoy deeper, more productive relationships
* Take ownership our _feelings_ and _actions_
* Stay conscious of _choice_ in every moment

Professionally, Nonviolent Communication has the benefit of making teams much more effective and more pleasant to work in. :smile:

## How it works
Nonviolent Communication helps us to be explicit and transparent about our **observations, feelings, needs, and strategies** (for meeting those needs). We all share the [same basic needs](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/feelings_needs.htm) (which are never in conflict) but we use strategies for meeting those needs which are sometimes in conflict. 

When someone does something we don't like, a typical NVC approach to resolving this situation could look like this:

>1. Make a clear **observation** of what happened, carefully avoiding any judgement, criticism, or blame
2. State **how you feel** in this moment
3. Articulate what **need** of yours is not being met
4. Make a clear **request** to help meet that need

Let's look a little deeper at each of these...
### Observing without judging
It's extremely difficult to observe without immediately judging and evaluating. Making judgements is something we're biologically hard-wired to do for our own survival and advancement. 

Practice identifying when you're making a judgement and instead try to make a clear observation. Even a statement like "You're yellling" can be interpreted as having an element of judgement or blame in it. Watch out for statements like "You always" or "you never". 

For example, instead of saying somethign like "you're always late" you might say "The past 3 times we've met, you've arrived more than 15 minutes after the agreed meeting time." This takes a lot of practice.

### Expressing feelings
Many cultures discourage openly expressing emotions as part of regular communication between people. We are often taught that being "emotional" is a sign of weakness or that it makes conversation more difficult. 

As a result of such cultural training, most of us have a very limited vocabularly with which to express our needs. It may be limited to "good", "bad", "pissed off", "angry", "happy", etc. 

However, when we clearly articulate and label our emotions (and don't mix them with observations, judgements, or strategeies), they become an extremely powerful (even vital) tool for understanding how well our needs are being met and how to move forward.

It's a useful exercise to write down some more nuanced words for expressing your emotions and practice using them on a regular basis. This way, they'll be available when you need them instead of making you feel like you can't express yourself (or be understood). 

Check out [this list](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/feelings_inventory_0.pdf) from the Centre for Nonviolent Communication.

#### Judgements disguised as feelings
It's also essential that we express actual needs and not judgements or evaluations. A statement beginning with "I feel" an an object (e.g. "I feel that...", "I feel they...") is often the start of an evaluation ("I feel that you're being unfair.") rather than a feeling ("I feel angry because this doesn't seem fair to me.").

### Expressing needs
We often (and for the same reasons) have similar trouble expressing our needs. In addition to developing a better vocuabularly for Develop your ["needs vocabularly"](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/feelings_needs.htm) and practice using it to articulate your needs in a given situation. 

#### Strategies disguised as needs
As before when we can try to express a feeling but actually express an evaluation, we can also rush into a strategy for meeting the need without actually expressing the need. "I need you to be quiet." is not a need but a request, or a strategy. The underlying need might be "I need to be heard and understood." Watch out for these.

### Making a clear request
Often (but not always) the final step after observing, feeling, and needing is to make a clear request that would help get our needs met. Sometimes, it is enough to simply express our observations and feelings, or our observations, feelings, and needs. But when we're ready to move into _strategies_ we need to articulate them as a request. 

If we don't make our requests clear, people won't be able to do what we ask. Rather than saying "Will you please listen to me." it's far more effective to ask "Would you be willing to wait to respond until I've finished speaking?" 

Furthermore, it's essential that our requests are never heard as _demands_. Practice articulating requests using postive language "Would you be willing to speak with an adult?" rather than as a demand "Don't hit me when you're angry or I won't talk to you." Notice, this last example included a threat. I'll talk more about the tragic fuitility of threats and punishment in a future post.

## Ways of speaking and listening
In our workshop, we also discussed how different ways of speaking and listening can either degrade or enhance communication between people. And how critical it is that we choose carefully, particularly when emotions come into play. A fun and useful "tool" for exploring this is the concept of Jackal and Giraffe Language.

{{<wide_pic jackal Resize "800x">}}

### Jackal Language

 Characterised as being harsh and aggressive "**Jackal language**" makes communication more difficult by assuming and judging without looking at root feelings and needs. 
 
 **Jackal Language**

* Implies wrongness, blame, or criticism
* Avoids making an empathic connection
* Seeks to be "right" about the situation
* Prompts attack or defensiveness
* Denies choice & responsibility

{{<wide_pic giraffe Resize "800x">}}

### Giraffe Language
By contrast, “**Giraffe language**” (Giraffes having the biggest hearts of any land animal) enhances connectedness and empathic communication by looking at the feelings and needs in both the speaker and the listener. 


 :ear:**Giraffe Language**

* Remains objective and non-judgemental
* Seeks to create an empathic connection based on feelings and needs
* Seeks understanding and clarity about the situation
* Empowers us through choice & responsibility

By using our different “ears” we can either hear blame, criticism, and attack or feelings, needs, and requests. 

According to Marshall Rosenberg, with "this technology" you'll never hear another insult or criticism again. 

> ### Everyone is only ever saying “Please” or “Thank you”. We just need to be able to hear them. :ear::wink:

## Going deeper
This is a tiny taste of what NVC has to offer but should provide you with some background and a few tools to try out. If you'd like to go deeper, I recommend reading the book :books: ["Nonviolent Communication, A Language of Life"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034) by Marshall Rosenberg or listening to this :cd: [9-hour audio programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I) given by Marhsall, himself. I really enjoy being able to hear his voice and relaxed, clear way of speaking. 

Thankfully, there are also a great deal of [videos online](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=marshall+rosenberg) featuring Mashall teaching including this [short introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-129JLTjkQ).

There are also hundreds of local NVC practice groups and training courses available around the world. 

If you'd like to learn more or practice with me, please [get in touch](/contact). Do you have experience with NVC? I'd love to hear your own observations about what you've found useful and how it's impacted your life. [Contact me.](/contact)
