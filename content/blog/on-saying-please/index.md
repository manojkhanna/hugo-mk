One of my favourite quotes from the founder of [Nonviolent Communication]({{< ref "/blog/introduction-to-nonviolent-communication-nvc">}}), [Marshall Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg), is that “people are only ever saying please and thank you”. 

When we use the word “please” to make a request, in almost any language, what we’re really saying is “if it pleases you”. We’re expressing consideration for another’s needs and asking them to only do what we’ve requested if it also helps meet their own needs.

Marshall talked a lot about what he called “natural giving“, the giving that springs naturally from our basic human need to contribute to the wellbeing of others. We are most "alive" as people, when we are participating in this state of pleasurable, natural giving and receiving. The purpose of “please” is to bring us into contact with this state. 

When done with compassion and sincerity, “please” can connect us deeply to the needs of others and give us the opportunity to meet their needs even as we meet our own.

By putting both the giver and the receiver into the flow of life where natural giving meets natural receiving, everybody wins.

So... will you try it, please? :wink:
