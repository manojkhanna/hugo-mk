## Quick start
> 
- Listen to [this 9hr audio course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I).
- Read the book [Nonvioleng Communication](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B07C6JQZ7H&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ibH5Ab9502BYP)
- Practice the 4 basic steps:
  1. Observe without judgement
  -  Identify the feelings stimulated by the event or behaviour observed in step 1
  - Identify the needs which are (or are not) being met through step 1
  - Make a clear request of the person for something they could do that would meet your needs
- Avoid language that conveys criticism, blame, demands, or insults this leads to giving out of a desire to avoid shame or guilt
- Stop using punishment
- People are only ever saying "Please" and "Thank you"
- Giraffe ears and Jackle ears (hearing 4 ways)
- Look for examples of violent language in our lives and our culture

## NVC and me

Several years ago while we were talking about intimate relationships, a friend introduced me to Nonviolent Communication (or NVC). It has since become an invaluable tool for me both personally and [professionally](/cv) in my [work](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) helping people work together to build [awesome things](http://www.gov.uk). I'm still very much what NVC practitioners might call a "baby giraffe" but I've recently been fortunate enough to share some of what I know with people around me. Read on for a quick introduction and some resources for further study.

## What is it?

[Marshall Rosenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg) (1934-2015), the founder of Nonviolent Communication, described it as a set of "skills and consciousness" which can keep us connected to our feelings and needs. In doing so, we greatly increase our chances of everyone having their needs met. He saw every act of violence as a "tragic expression of an unmet need".

## Where did it come from?
Marshall grew up in Detroit where he experienced anti-semitism and witnessed the [race riots of 1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_race_riot_of_1943). At the time, his paralysed grandmother lived with him and every evening, Marshall's uncle would come around to care for her. The compassionate and joyful way in which his uncle carried out what seemed, to Marshalll, to be very difficult and unpleasant tasks, affected him deeply. Initially, he suspected that violence was perpetrated by people who were "sick" and that compassionate giving was carried out by those who were "well" and perhaps he could learn to "cure" those who were sick so he studied psychology. Just before completing his PhD, however, his professor Michael Hakim helped him to see the limitations and political dangers of the concept of ["mental illness"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I&t=7%3A00). After completing his degree he studied comparative religions and noticed the theme of compassionate giving and the joy of using mankind's resources to help improve the human condition.

He called this "natural giving" and believed that compassionate giving from the heart is our natural state but somehow we have "unlearned" how to do this. So he asked what skills were necessary to live compassionately.

## Domination cultures
According to the theologan [Walter Wink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wink), we got off track about 10, 000 years ago when certain socio-political power-structures emerged wherein some people are "right" and others are "wrong". Maintaining these structures requires ["a certain way of thinking, communicating, and using power"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I&t=12:20) to keep people subordinate.<sup>1</sup> As such, modern notions of punishment and retribution have surfaced and become part of our popular culture.

As part of this, Marshall believed that we've made violence towards others enjoyable. We've found ways that suggest certain people _deserve_ to suffer for their actions.
Marshall often pointed out that most of our popular entertainment features a hero who, at the climax of a given film or TV programme, either kills someone or beats them up.

## Punishment and reward
Using systems of punishment and reward distance us from our needs and the needs of others and create a language that denies choice. This can become very dangerous.

Marshall tells the story of the Nazi war criminal [Adolf Eichmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann) who, when asked if it was difficult to send millions of people to their deaths, replied (according to Rosenberg) "To tell you the truth, it was easy. Our language made it easy." When pressed, further he talked about a language they called "[Amptssprache](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Amtssprache)", literally "office speak", which removes accountability from the individual. People are able to say things like "superior's orders", "I had no choice", "It's the law" instead of accepting resonsibility for one's actions. NVC helps us to remain conscious of choice in every moment. We may not like every action that we take, but we don't do anything that we don't explicitly choose to do.

Two questions that help convince people that punishment is unnecessary.
1. If somebody's doing something you don't like, what would you like them to do differently?

  _Asking only this question, people might think that punishment sometimes works. But now ask the second question:_

2. What do you want the other person's _reasons_ to be for doing what you request of them?

This makes it pretty obvious that when people see us as a source of danger or reward, they give out of a very different engergy than when they own their own choices.
