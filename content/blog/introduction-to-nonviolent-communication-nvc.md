**Nonviolent Communication** or NVC (which, even the founder Marshall Rosenberg, thought was a silly name) is a vast and nuanced area of study but the basic principles can be applied almost immediately. I recently had the opportunity to give a brief training session to a few work colleagues. Here are the main points we covered as well as a few resources for future study.

> ### Nonviolent Communication connects us to our own feelings and needs and the feelings and needs of others.

This allows us to do the following:

* Resolve conflict in many areas of our lives
* Enjoy deeper, more productive relationships
* Take ownership our feelings and _actions_
* Embrace our power of _choice_ in every moment

NVC also has the useful side-effect of making teams much more effective and pleasant to work in. :smile:


Nonviolent Communication helps us to clearly articulate and differentiate our **observations, feelings, needs, and strategies** (for meeting our needs). We all share the same basic needs (which are never in conflict) but we use different strategies for meeting those needs (which are sometimes in conflict). The basic pattern of turning around a difficult situation is to:

1. Make a clear **observation** avoiding any language that implies judgement, evaluation, criticism, or blame
2. State how you **feel** in this moment
3. Define what needs of yours are not being met by what is happening
4. Make a clear **request** which you think will help meet that need (the strategy)

We also discussed "**Jackal language**" which makes communication more difficult by

* implying blame and criticism
* denying responsibility and choice

In contrast, “**Giraffe language**” (Giraffes having the biggest hearts of any land animal)  

  - remains objective and non-judgemental
  - focuses on feelings and needs
  - empowers us through choice. 

Using our different “ears” we can either hear blame, criticism, and selfishness or feelings, needs, and requests. According to Marshall, everyone is only ever saying “Please” or “Thank you” ;)
