## Quick start
> 
- Listen to [this 9hr audio course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I).
- Read the book [Nonvioleng Communication](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B07C6JQZ7H&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ibH5Ab9502BYP)
- Practice the 4 basic steps:
  1. Observe without judgement
  -  Identify the feelings stimulated by the event or behaviour observed in step 1
  - Identify the needs which are (or are not) being met through step 1
  - Make a clear request of the person for something they could do that would meet your needs
- Avoid language that conveys criticism, blame, demands, or insults this leads to giving out of a desire to avoid shame or guilt
- Stop using punishment
- People are only ever saying "Please" and "Thank you"
- Giraffe ears and Jackle ears (hearing 4 ways)
- Look for examples of violent language in our lives and our culture

## NVC and me

Several years ago while we were talking about intimate relationships, a friend introduced me to Nonviolent Communication (or NVC). It has since become an invaluable tool for me both personally and [professionally](/cv) in my [work](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) helping people work together to build [awesome things](http://www.gov.uk). I'm still very much what NVC practitioners might call a "baby giraffe" but I've recently been fortunate enough to share some of what I know with people around me. Read on for a quick introduction and some resources for further study.

## What is it?

[Marshall Rosenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg) (1934-2015), the founder of Nonviolent Communication, described it as a set of "skills and consciousness" which can keep us connected to our feelings and needs. In doing so, we greatly increase our chances of everyone having their needs met. He saw every act of violence as a "tragic expression of an unmet need".

## Where did it come from?
Marshall grew up in Detroit where he experienced anti-semitism and witnessed the [race riots of 1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_race_riot_of_1943). At the time, his paralysed grandmother lived with him and every evening, Marshall's uncle would come around to care for her. The compassionate and joyful way in which his uncle carried out what seemed, to Marshalll, to be a very difficult and unpleasant task, also affected him deeply. 

Initially, he suspected that violence was perpetrated by people who were "sick" and that if he could "cure" those people, they would, again, be able to embrace compassionate giving. And so he studied psychology. Just before completing his PhD, however, his professor Michael Hakim helped him to see the limitations and great danger inherent in the concept of ["mental illness"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I&t=7%3A00). So, after completing his degree, he studied comparative religions and noticed the common theme of giving from the heart and using mankind's resources to help improve the entire human condition.

He called this "natural giving" and believed that it is our natural state but somehow we have "unlearned" how to do this. But how has this "unlearning" come about?

## Domination cultures
According to the theologan [Walter Wink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wink), we got off track about 10,000 years ago when certain sociopolitical power structures emerged. Maintaining these structures requires, according to Marshall, ["a certain way of thinking, communicating, and using power"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4tUVqsjQ2I&t=12:20) that keeps people compliant. It becomes necessary to evaluate and label the behaviour of some people as "right" and others as "wrong". By this requirement to make moralistic evaluations, modern systems of punishment and reward have emerged as everyday components of our culture.

This also makes violence towards others _enjoyable_. When we believe certain people are "bad" it is easy to believe that they _deserve to suffer_ for their actions. Marshall was fond of pointing out that most of our popular entertainment revolves around a hero who, at the climax of the story, "either kills someone or beats someone up."

## Punishment and reward
Furthermore, systems of punishment and reward deny us the power of choice. They suggest that we act, not out of choice, but out of a desire for reward and avoidance of pain.

This is very dangerous.

Marshall tells the story of the Nazi war criminal [Adolf Eichmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann) who, when asked if it was difficult for him to send millions of people to their deaths, replied (according to Rosenberg) "To tell you the truth, it was easy. Our language made it easy." When pressed, further he talked about a language they called "[Amptssprache](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Amtssprache)", literally "office speak", which removed accountability from the individual. They were able to justify their actions by saying things like "they were the superior's orders", "I had no choice", "It's the law". NVC helps us to stay connected to choice moment by moment. We may not like every action that we take, but we don't do anything that we don't explicitly choose to do.

If you're still not convinced that punishment and reward are unnecessary, try asking these two questions when somebody is doing somethign you don't like:
1. What would you like them to do differently?

  <span style="color: #333">Asking only this question, people might think that punishment _sometimes_ works. But now ask the second question.</span>

2. What do you want the other person's **reasons** to be for doing what you request of them?

This makes it pretty obvious that when people begin to see us as a personal threat or source of reward, they act from a very different engergy than when they own their decisions and act out of compassionate choice. 

See Alfie Kohn's book "[Punished by Rewards](https://www.alfiekohn.org/punished-rewards/)"
