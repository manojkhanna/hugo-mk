As organisations move away from thinking about projects with fixed budgets, scope  and timelines, focusing, instead, on long-running digital services that can evolve over time, teams need a way to see their actual expenses in the context of their plans and regularly update their forecasts and resource needs so everyone in the organisation can make timely, evidence-based decisions that keep delivery on track.

While I was at the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/), we developed a simple, web-based (cloud) template which could be used by every team and easily "rolled-up" to give anyone a real-time view of spending, vacancies, and people allocation at a team or group level or even across the entire organisation.

I've created a short tutorial and made the template open source so you can use it, yourself. Questions or ideas? <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a>.
