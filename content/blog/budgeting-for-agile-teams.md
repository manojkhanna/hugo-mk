title: Budgeting for agile teams

As organisations move away from thinking about projects with fixed budgets, scope  and timelines, focusing, instead, on long-running digital services that can evolve over time, teams need a way to see their actual expenses in the context of their plans and regularly update their forecasts and resource needs so everyone in the organisation can make timely, evidence-based decisions that keep delivery on track.

Through my work with various clients, I've learned a lot about simple ways to forecast and track headcount, vacancies, spend, milestones, etc so that teams and stakeholders can easily see where they are and stay on track. I've created a simple template that brings together a lot of what I learned in a concise, cloud-based format which should serve as a good starting point for small agile teams. This technique could even be used across an entire portfolio by "rolling up" the data into a portfolio-wide view.

**Please note: This tool contains no personal or proprietary data.** All data including but not limited to names, rates, line-items, roles, and pay-grades is completely fictitious and for demonstration purposes only. See the "README" tab for full terms of use.

With that out of the way, I've created a <b>5 min</b> screencast to show you how to use it yourself. If you have any questions or ideas I would love it if you would <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
