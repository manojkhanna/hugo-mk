Some time ago, the always brilliant [Nick Tate] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-tait-86516b1) shared this useful, [10 minute video](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen)
 from [Julian Treasure](http://www.juliantreasure.com/) with tips for public speaking. 
 
 Here are a few notes I’ve taken for quick reference: 

## The Seven Deadly Sins of speaking
- Gossip
- Judging
- Negativity
- Complaining
- Excuses & Blaming - *"Some people have a 'blame-thrower'"*
- Embroidery, exaggeration, drama… all forms of lying
- Dogmatism (confusion of facts with opinions)


So how can we avoid these? Julian has developed the following mnemonic: 

## Four cornerstones for great public speaking
**“HAIL”** - e.g. to greet or acclaim enthusiastically

 - **Honesty** - Be clear and straight
 - **Authenticity** - being your own self (“Stand in your own truth”)
 - **Integrity** - be your word (be trustable)
 - **Love** - Wish people well, act in good faith

## Vocal tools

Here are some tools you can use to vary the quality of your speaking and help get your message across:

**Register**: Whether you speak in your nose, throat, or chest. Go low for depth and power.

**Timbre**: how your voice feels (research says we prefer rich, smooth, warm. Get a coach if you need one to help improve the timbre.)

**Prosody**: The sing-song meta-language. The opposite of monotone. Rhythm, cadence, melody.

**Pace**: vary the pace according to your message. Speed can convey energy and excitement, slowness can give weight and emphasis. Silence. Nothing wrong with that. Use silence instead of “ummmm” or “uhhh” and when you want the audience to think.

**Pitch**: can support the meaning of your words.

**Volume**: Loud can be exciting. Quiet can make people pay close attention to a specific piece. Broadcasting the whole time is called “Sod-casting”… imposing your sound on everyone all the time carelessly and inconsiderately. 

## Warm up your voice!
Here are six exercises Julian does before every big conversation:

1. Stand up. Arms up, deep breath in, and big sigh out
2. Lips: “Bah bah bah bah bah”
3. “BBBBBBBBBBBBBB”
4. “LALALALALALALA” (tip of the tongue)
5. “RRRRRRRRRR” (Roll the Rrrrr to warm up the sides of the tongue)
6. "Weeeeooooooooaaahhhheeeeoooo" (known as "The Siren")
