title: Running an OKR setting workshop

Over the past year, I’ve been helping dozens of teams at a large media organisation to adopt OKRs. A major part of this has been facilitating OKR-setting workshops and teaching others to facilitate them. <!--Part of this role has involved running lots of OKR setting (and reviewing) workshops and helping teams to run their own workshops in the future. I thought it would be useful to jot down some thoughts on how I’ve been running these workshops for single teams and multiple teams together. --> Here's how I've been doing them. Much of this is adapted from [Christina Wodtke’s](http://eleganthack.com/) book [Radical Focus](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Focus-Achieving-Important-Objectives/dp/0996006028/). <!--neatly summarised by my brilliant colleague [Nora Bereczkei](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/norabereczkei).-->

## Ground rules
One of the great strengths of OKRs is that they force teams to get really clear on what they want (and don’t want) to achieve in a given time period (typically a 3 month quarter). As such, setting the team's OKRs requires plenty of passionate debate until things are clear and everyone knows what they’re committing to. This is the time to iron out any confusion or ambiguity; not half-way through or at the end of the quarter when you're reporting on what you've achieved. There should be very little "wiggle room" for interpretation once they've been nailed down.

Ideally the OKR setting session should be small (10 people max). Put phones and laptops away. This is a time to really engage with your colleagues and understand what they think is important and why. More focus means higher quality OKRs and a shorter meeting. Ideally, you’ll have a facilitator from outside the team who can guide the conversation and take notes so the team can be fully present with each other.

## Before the session
A day (or two max) before the meeting, invite everyone on the team to submit their top objective for the team to achieve in the next quarter. For large teams, you might do this via a survey. Appoint someone to collect, analyse, and bring the most popular ideas to the workshop.

Set aside about 4 hours to run the session. If you really focus, you can do it in two hours and give people a couple of hours back, but it’s important not to feel rushed, especially the first few times a team does this. Find a quiet room with plenty of wall space.

## Running the session

### Picking the objective(s)
Put each objective on a sticky note on the wall. Do some affinity mapping: put similar objectives adjacent to each other and duplicates on top of each other. Debate, [dot-vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting), and debate some more until you determine your top objective (or two or three if you must :grimacing:).

### Picking some metrics
Now that you have a single, inspiring, important, scary objective (or maybe two or three), it’s time to figure out what metrics will show that you’re getting closer to achieving this thing. Spend 5-10 minutes free listing as many metrics as you can think of but using place holders for specific targets.

For example, if your objective is to "Become the world's foremost expert on classic synthesisers". You might have a metric around "Number of synth models played this quarter" or, to start forming it as a Key Result: "Play X different synth models".

A good test of your metric is to pretend that you're mid-way through the next quarter. Does looking at this metric help you decide what do do this week? Or does it feel silly, irrelevant, or even annoying in the context of your bigger goals?

Once you've written these down, do some affinity mapping and dot-voting, and discussion as before with the objectives to narrow your metrics down to 2-3 per objective.

### Add targets to make metrics into Key Results
Once you've agreed the right metrics for your objectives, it's time to set some specific targets. This is what sets a metric or KPI apart from a Key Result. It's also the place where you can really dial up or down the level of challenge to achieve the right level of "motivational discomfort"! :wink:

Remember that Key Results should be a little scary. If the team has a metric to track "Unique synth models played this quarter" then the Key result might look like "Play X different synth models this quarter". Setting X to 3 might not be very challenging. One of us could nail that with one trip to the music shop. Setting it to 100, however, might be unrealistic and demotivating. The challenge is to find a number that feels scary but which kickstarts our creative thinking for how we can meet the target. Maybe it's 10 or 20 or 50... Discuss each metric with the team until you've identified the right targets to make each one feel like an exciting and useful challenge. Remember that on day one, you should feel like you have about a 50% chance of actually achieving your Key Results.


## Test them out!

Take a look at your beautiful, newly drafted OKRs.

1. Is the Objective big and aspirational?
2. Do the Key Results make sense?
  - Are they clear and unambiguous?
  - Are they easy to measure?
  - Are they results and not "tasks"?
  - Are they tough and inspiring?
3. Are you happy to measure your team's success this quarter based on reaching 70-90% of these goals (and nothing else)?

## Share, tweak, and commit
If you've answered "yes" to most of the above, they're ready to show to other teams and stakeholders for feedback. This is your chance to gather valuable feedback, give feedback to others and generally align your goals across the entire organisation. You might discover that you need to tweak some of the language or the targets themselves. You may have missed something major or included something which other parts of your organisation didn't expect or is already doing. Spend a couple of weeks debating further within your team and across other teams and stakeholders until you're ready to commit and start delivering!
