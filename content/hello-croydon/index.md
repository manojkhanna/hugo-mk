Hello!

I'm both humbled and honoured to be invited to apply for the role of Croydon's first Chief Digital Officer. _Thank you!_

<!--When my dad brought home our first home computer in the 80's (the original Apple Macintosh) I was transfixed. Days later, I'd started using it to make art, draw mazes, and build simple games. Thirty years on, whether coding to scratch my own itch, or helping individuals, teams, and organisations to improve their digital capability, I'm still hooked.--> <!--It can energise communities, proliferate knowledge, and exponentially increase opportunity.-->

From running my own digital agency to consulting for the likes of the BBC, and the Cabinet Office, I've spent the past twenty years helping individuals, teams, and entire organisations to improve their digital capability and work better together. <!--Digital technology is a vital tool for growing cities. The two go hand in hand. --> Whether it's rolling out new user-centred digital public services or leveraging the power of emerging tech like AI, Big Data, or [LiFi](https://www.lifi.eng.ed.ac.uk) to build truly "smart cities", right now is an amazing time to be applying digital solutions to emerging civic challenges.

But digital transformation is really about people, not technology. It’s about relationships, curiosity, and the willingness to improve outcomes. It’s about understanding user needs, knowing where to get help, and consistently applying constructive, supportive, energy to get the job done. 

And the job is never “Done”; it just gets more interesting. Continuous improvement is <!--just that: continuous. It is--> its own reward and the benefits are limitless.

<!--
I have a strong background in design, technology, and business. As much as I love building apps, opening up public data-sets, and deploying new services, I'm equally passionate about techniques such as [Nonviolent Communication](http://www.peterkappus.com/blog/introduction-to-nonviolent-communication-nvc/), digging deep into user needs, and applying existing, often deliberately low-tech tools in new ways to create powerful results. -->

I've helped the BBC to stay competitive by setting goals the Google way, I helped central government save billions of pounds, get better outcomes, and support more British SMEs by delivering the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/). I rolled out a real-time, highly transparent, [agile portfolio practice](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/11/delivery-operations-using-gds-data-to-make-better-decisions/) allowing the Government Digital Service to secure nearly £500m of funding in a fiercely competitive spending review. Yet, what I'm most proud of is having created environments where innovation and continuous improvement naturally flourished.

I'm passionate about techniques such as [Nonviolent Communication](http://www.peterkappus.com/blog/introduction-to-nonviolent-communication-nvc/), systems thinking, and applying existing, often deliberately low-tech tools in new ways to create powerful results (often at significantly lower cost than buying the shiniest thing off the shelf).

<!--In light of Theo Blackwell's compelling and ambitious "<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/smart-london/smarter-london-together" target="_blank">Smarter London Together</a>" roadmap,--> I'm excited to learn more about what Croydon's 360,000 residents and 1500+ digital businesses need to thrive and explore ways that I can help. Please see my CV attached or browse it via http://peterkappus.com/cv. I look forward to speaking with you.

Thank you,
<br>Peter Kappus

<!--At the risk of solution-ising without much context, A few ideas come immediately to mind:
- Create an “innovation studio” within the council to act as a hub for exploring new ideas, prototyping solutions, spreading enthusiasm for a powerful digital future.
- Create an "academy" programme to promote basic digital literacy within the council
- Continue and expand the terrific work being done with Go On Croydon to ensure that we include everyone.
- Create an outstanding environment for digital businesses to thrive in Croydon by opening up civic data and nurturing strategic partnerships with local businesses, social enterprises, and other government bodies.-->
