  title: Let's get digital, Croydon!

I'm humbled and honoured to be applying for the role of Croydon's first Chief Digital Officer. _Thank you!_

When my dad brought home our first home computer in the 80's (the original Apple Macintosh) I was transfixed. Days later, I'd started using it to make art, draw mazes, and build simple games. Thirty years on, whether coding to scratch my own itch, or helping individuals, teams, and organisations to improve their digital capability, I'm still hooked. <!--It can energise communities, proliferate knowledge, and exponentially increase opportunity.-->

Digital technology is a vital tool for growing cities. The two go hand in hand. Whether rolling out new user-centred digital public services or leveraging the power of emerging tech like AI, Big Data, or [LiFi](https://www.lifi.eng.ed.ac.uk) to build truly "smart cities", it's an amazing time to be applying digital solutions to emerging civic challenges.

But digital transformation is really about people, not technology. It’s about relationships, curiosity, and the willingness to improve outcomes. It’s about understanding user needs, knowing where to get help, and applying gentle, positive, persistence to get the job done. But the job is never “done”, it just gets more interesting. Continuous improvement is <!--just that: continuous. It is--> its own reward and the benefits are limitless.

I've helped the BBC to set goals like Google, I helped revolutionise [digital procurement at the Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/), and rolled out a real-time, highly transparent, [agile portfolio practice](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/11/delivery-operations-using-gds-data-to-make-better-decisions/) allowing them to secure nearly £500m of funding in a fiercely competitive spending review. In spite of all this, what I'm most proud of is having created environments where innovation and continuous improvement naturally flourished.

<!--My best digital transformation work has been about two things: simplicity, and humanity.--> I'm passionate about techniques such as [Nonviolent Communication](http://www.peterkappus.com/blog/introduction-to-nonviolent-communication-nvc/), maintaining a clear focus on user needs, and using existing, often deliberately low-tech tools in new ways to create powerful results.<!-- (often for far less investment than simply buying the shiniest newest thing off the shelf). -->

In light of Theo Blackwell's compelling and ambitious "<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/smart-london/smarter-london-together" target="_blank">Smarter London Together</a>" roadmap, I'm excited to learn more about what Croydon needs from its first CDO and explore how I can help.

<!--At the risk of solution-ising without much context, A few ideas come immediately to mind:
- Create an “innovation studio” within the council to act as a hub for exploring new ideas, prototyping solutions, spreading enthusiasm for a powerful digital future.
- Create an "academy" programme to promote basic digital literacy within the council
- Continue and expand the terrific work being done with Go On Croydon to ensure that we include everyone.
- Create an outstanding environment for digital businesses to thrive in Croydon by opening up civic data and nurturing strategic partnerships with local businesses, social enterprises, and other government bodies.-->
